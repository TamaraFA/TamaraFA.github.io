From October 2020, I am assistant professor at the . I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Gatsby Unit, working with Arthur Gretton. I joined the Gatsby Unit in 2018 as a Biometrika postdoctoral fellow. In 2018, I obtained my DPhil in Statistics at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Yee Whye Teh. My work has been focused on extending modern machine learning techniques to classical statistical problems, in particular to Survival Analysis.
